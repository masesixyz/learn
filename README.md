# My Learning Odyssey

This document is my personal learning journal as I dive into machine learning, programming, compiler design, blockchain, and cryptography. It’s where I’ll track my progress, document what I’ve learned, and share the resources that have helped me along the way. My goal is to understand how these fields connect and apply them in real-world scenarios. Think of it as a mix of discoveries, notes, and aha moments as I make sense of algorithms, systems, decentralized tech, and secure communication.
